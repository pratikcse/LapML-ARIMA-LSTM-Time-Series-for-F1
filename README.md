# **GeoPredict: Earthquake and Storm Disaster Management**

## **Overview**

**GeoPredict** is an interactive web application designed to predict natural disasters, specifically earthquakes and heavy storms (rainfall). Built using Django, this application integrates real-time data collection, time-series forecasting using ARIMA models, and machine learning (LSTM) for event prediction. GeoPredict provides an interactive dashboard to display live disaster data and predictions, enabling early alerts and better disaster management.

## **Features**

* **Earthquake and Storm Prediction**: Predicts the occurrence and intensity of earthquakes and heavy storms using time series analysis and machine learning models.
* **Real-time Data Collection**: Fetches real-time disaster data via APIs (e.g., Ergast API for lap times, weather data, etc.).
* **ARIMA-based Time Series Prediction**: Uses ARIMA models for forecasting earthquake and storm events based on historical data.
* **LSTM Model for Lap Time Prediction**: Uses an LSTM model for predicting future lap times during race simulations.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays predictions, real-time data, and other statistics to users in an easy-to-understand interface.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Backend**: Django, Python
* **Machine Learning**: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
* **Data Storage**: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (for production)
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (for responsive design)
* **API Integrations**: Ergast API (race data), Weather API (for storm data), etc.
* **Data Science Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Torch

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Requirements**

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Django 3.x or higher
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Torch
* PostgreSQL (optional for production)

### **Steps for Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geopredict.git
   cd geopredict
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:

   * For development, SQLite is used by default.
   * To use PostgreSQL, update the `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py`.

5. **Run database migrations**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser** to access the Django admin:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Access the app**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view the project.

## **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection**:

   * Earthquake data is fetched using a third-party API (e.g., Ergast for racing-related data).
   * Storm data is fetched from relevant meteorological APIs.
   * Data is stored in the database for prediction.

2. **Time Series Prediction**:

   * The **ARIMA model** is used to predict the future behavior of earthquakes and storms based on historical data. The model is implemented and trained using the `statsmodels` library.

3. **Lap Time Prediction**:

   * The **LSTM model** is used for predicting future lap times in racing simulations.
   * The LSTM model is trained using historical lap times and used to forecast future laps.

4. **Prediction**:

   * Once the necessary data is collected, the system predicts future events (earthquakes, storms, and lap times) using the ARIMA or LSTM models.
   * Results are displayed in real-time on the dashboard.

## **Key Functions**

### 1. **`create_lstm_model()`**

* Creates an LSTM model for lap time prediction. Configures the model’s input size, hidden layer size, number of layers, and output size.

### 2. **`prepare_lstm_data()`**

* Prepares data for LSTM by converting lap times into seconds and normalizing them for model input.

### 3. **`train_lstm_model()`**

* Trains the LSTM model on the provided data, optimizing the model’s weights using the backpropagation algorithm.

### 4. **`predict_next_lap_time()`** (ARIMA)

* Uses the ARIMA model to predict the next lap time based on historical data.
* Converts lap times into seconds and applies the ARIMA model to forecast future times.

### 5. **`predict_next_lap_lstm()`** (LSTM)

* Predicts the next lap time using the trained LSTM model, based on the last `n` lap times.

### 6. **`lstm_simulation()`**

* Manages the entire lap time prediction simulation.
* Fetches lap times from the database or API, processes them, and predicts future lap times.
* Calculates error metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE) for performance evaluation.

## **Statistics and Metrics**

The app calculates various statistics for the race or disaster predictions, including:

* **Fastest Lap**: The fastest lap time from the provided data.
* **Average Lap Time**: The average lap time of all valid laps.
* **Prediction Error**: The absolute difference between predicted and actual lap times.
* **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual lap times.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: The square root of the MSE, representing the model’s accuracy in predicting future lap times.
